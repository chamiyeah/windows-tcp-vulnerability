# windows-tcp-vulnerability
This is a proof of concept &amp; working prototype of a windows reverse shell exploitation. This explotation is based on Reverse TCP Shell Attack principals and provided python code can be utilized to create a windows powershell terminal acsess to victim computer insted of regular cmd prompt. 
Due to the nature of the connection and when used with a obfuscate algorithm, Windows defender is totally blind on this attack and this poses a serious security threat. This repo is made to make awareness regarding this vulnerability and to use as a reference to find malicious code even when the anti-virus program lets pass it.

## Initializing
The provided shell.ps1 script is a windows powershell sript, which is made to ivoke a tcp connection to the attacker`s computer. This script use stranderd tcp shell command fused with added file upload and download functions. 

Provided reverseshell.py script is what a attacker would use to listen to the incoming TCP calls and to stablish a connection. This script uses the socket module for communication and it is using the subprocess module to execute commands and interact with the PowerShell script.

## List, Upload & Download Functions
This has support for three added commands: "execute," "upload," and "download." The "execute" command allows you to run PowerShell commands on the Windows computer, the "upload" command allows you to upload files to the Windows computer, and the "download" command allows you to download files from the Windows computer.
